CU-ROBOTICS: Data Generator
=================================================

This program uses green screened images of armor plates and backgrounds in order to generate images emulating the look and distortion of our robots camera.

Introduction
------------

This is my first project working with python. It uses OpenCV primarily to modify all of the images and numpy in order to work with arrays and matrices.
 

Usage
-----

The only script creates both an output zip based on how many iterations it runs through and an example folder for easier access to a limited amount of example data.


Known issues and limitations
----------------------------

- The mask of the image is slightly off on certain images, leaving a green mark or line
- Produced images are not like our camera but rather are just generalized
- Not fully tested and performance controlled
